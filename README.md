Credit card fraud is a form of identity theft in which an individual uses someone else's credit card information to charge purchases, or to withdraw funds from the 
account. Credit card fraud also includes the fraudulent use of a debit card, and may be accomplished by the theft of the actual card, or by illegally obtaining the 
cardholder's account and personal information, including the card number, the card's security number, and the cardholder's name and address. Policing agencies from 
the local police department, to the U.S. Secret Service are on the job enforcing fraud laws as they related to credit card fraud.

Nowadays, credit and debit card transactions are more common than cash in the United States. This gives digital criminals all the opportunity they could want to commit
credit card fraud. And every year, they succeed at least some of the time with 52 million Americans experiencing credit card fraud last year. Credit card security has 
become increasingly critical as the U.S. and other countries edge towards becoming a cashless economy. American consumers rely heavily on credit cards, supplying 
fraudsters with a steady stream of potential targets. Four out of five American adults today possess at least one credit card, and three of five cardholders have 
experienced unauthorized charges - an estimated 128 million victims. Seventy-five percent of those victims said they've had credit card fraud more than once.

finally, Americans use credit or debit cards to make 60 percent of their payments, and that proportion is steadily rising. This continuing march towards a cashless 
society may reduce violent crime and corruption while elevating convenience but also expanding opportunities for fraud.  128 million Americans have been victimized by 
credit card fraud, 52 million in the last year alone â€” more than 90 percent of those crimes employed remote technology without access to a physical card. 
Positive practices (billing reviews, card notifications, credit monitoring, and multi-factor authentication) improve financial safety but can be undone by risky 
consumer habits (poorly managed credentials, insecure networks, comingling of disparate card uses).  As more cardholders embrace digital wallets and institutions 
turn to artificial intelligence and quantum connections for next-gen security measures, the number of victims may decline. Unfortunately, criminals often adapt and 
stay one step ahead, so all credit card users should remain vigilant.
